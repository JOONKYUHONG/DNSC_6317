### About Course

**Course Description**
Students will learn practical tools for integrating their analytical skills into real-world problem solving for businesses and organizations. The course provides approaches that can be applied immediately to a wide variety of settings, whether one is working as an analyst/data scientist (or frontline manager) within an organization, or for an external consulting-focused organization. This is a hands-on workshop style course, meaning that it provides opportunities to use the tools and techniques discussed in class.

Students will apply these capabilities as they work in teams on an industry project. The project is provided by one of our partner firms and will entail working closely with the firmâ€™s project sponsors over the semester and presenting findings to them at the end of the project. Students will have access to, or source, real data and work collaboratively with specifically designated mentors at the partner organization. The practicum is designed to apply the knowledge gained in the classroom to real-world problems. The experience is designed to allow students to develop deep expertise in a set of analytical tools and business and communication skills required for the successful completion of analytics projects.

Every class session will have a lecture portion and an in-class group assignment meeting. You will continue the exercises outside of class within your assigned groups for weekly homework assignments, which will be graded. Expectations of the weekly deliverables from the assignments will be clearly outlined by the professor
